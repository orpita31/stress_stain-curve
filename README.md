# stress_stain-curve
Analysis and Comparison of the Mechanical Behavior of Materials Using Stress vs. Strain Curves and Normalized Curves.

##  Analysis:

Here As in stress vs strain curve the material breaks suddenly after reaching maximum stress ( the elongation after maximum stress is less) thats why its a brittle failour .
