# stress_stain-curve
analysis and comparison mechanical behavior of material using stress vs strain curve and Normalized stress vs normalized strain curve

##  Analysis:

Here As in stress vs strain curve the material breaks suddenly after reaching maximum stress ( the elongation after maximum stress is less) thats why its a brittle failour .
